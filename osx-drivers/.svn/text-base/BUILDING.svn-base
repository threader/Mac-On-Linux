To build the OS X drivers for Mac-on-Linux, you will need:
XCode
OSX-10.2.8-SDK
X11-SDK

The drivers can only be built on OSX.  You must specifiy the SDK location
using the SDK_DIR enviroment variable.  I recommend exporting it before
building like this:

	$ export SDK_DIR="/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.2.8.sdk/"
	
Once the environment is configured:

	$ make
	$ make target

The resulting binary files can be found in the target directory, note that 
building the final target requires sudo privileges.
