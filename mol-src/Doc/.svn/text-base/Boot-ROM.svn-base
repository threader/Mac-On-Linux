Oldworld Booting
================

	To boot earlier version of MacOS than 8.6, an image of a 
	supported boot-ROM is needed. Booting using a boot-ROM image
	is called oldworld booting.

	Note: MacOS 8.6 and later can be booted using
	a "newworld" ROM (a file in the System Folder). This
	is the (strongly) recommended way of booting MacOS. 
	The rest of this document addresses oldworld booting
	though.


Support ROM images
==================

	Images from one of the following computers are known to work:

		PowerMacintosh 7200, 7300, 7500, 7600, 8200, 8500, 9600
		PowerCenter Pro
		Starmax 4160
		Umax J700/180
		Umax SuperMac C500
		PowerBase 200 (180, 240)
		Performa 6400

	Most (almost all) of the ROMs above can be used together with the
	8500 oftree.

	ROM-images from the following machines *might* be usable:

		PowerMacintosh 7215, 8515, 9500, 9515.
		PowerMacintosh 8600
		PowerMacintosh 5400
		Umax SuperMac J710, C600

	It is also *possible* that an image from one of the following 
	machines work:

		Genesis LT, 
		Power Macintosh 8600/200
		PowerTower
		PowerTower Pro
		PowerTower Pro G3
		PowerCurve
		Powerwave
		Umax SuperMac S900
		Umax SuperMac J700
		Genesis MP
		Millennium G3, 604

	ROM images from other machines with the Catalyst, Nitro or 
	Tsunami architecture might also work (try these ROMs also 
	with the 8500 oftree).

	There is a ROM grabbing utility on the ftp-site:

		ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/home/f95-sry/Public/mac-on-linux/

	If no ROM-image is specified, the built-in ROM will be used
	(which probably won't work unless MOL is running on one
	of the supported machines).


Using a Boot-ROM
================

	First make sure /etc/mol/molrc.ow is included from /etc/mol/molrc.

	Secondly, specify the location of the ROM-image in /etc/mol/molrc.ow,
	for instance

		rom_image:	rom/rom.8500

	There is also another setting which might need some tuning:

		oftree:		oftrees/oftree.8500

	Most of the supported roms work well with the 8500 oftree. 
	There are a few others in /usr/share/mol/0.9.XX/oftrees 
	though.
