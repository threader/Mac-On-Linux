# Mouse Configuration
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	One of the following settings should probably be used:
#
#	 device		      protocol
#	-------------------------------
#	/dev/input/mice,	usb         # might work with ADB too
#	/dev/adbmouse,		adb		
#	/dev/usbmouse,		usb
#	/dev/mouse,		ps2
#	    -                 console       # for old kernels
#

#mouse_device:		/dev/input/mice
mouse_protocol:		usb

mouse_dpi:		140
use_x_cursor:		yes		# use X-cursor as mouse cursor


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Keyboard Configuration
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	Almost all Apple keyboards have an unique ID, and it affects how 
#	MacOS deals with key map tables and such. Unless a non-Roman
#	script system is used, modification of this ID will have no
#	great effect.
#
#	Hint: For ADB keyboards, the ID might be printed during bootup:
#		.....
#		ADB devices: [2]: 2 22 [3]: 3 1
#		              ^     ^
#		       	      |     +- The second number ("22" here) is the keyboard ID.
#			This "2" indicates that it's an ADB keyboard.
#
#	Sample IDs:
#
#	   1  Apple Standard Keyboard
#	   2  Apple Extended Keyboard
#	   4  Apple ISO Keyboard
#	   5  Apple Ext. ISO Keyboard II
#	  22  JIS Apple Keyboard II
#	 195  PowerBook Titanium, iBook
#	 200  JIS USB Keyboard

keyboard_id:		5


#	Older kernels in general use ADB keycodes. MOL tries to auto-detect
#	whether ADB or linux keycodes are used, but this setting can be forced
#	by uncommenting the following line:
#
#		use_linux_keycodes:	yes


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Keyboard Layout Customization
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	Normally, the keyboard layout is configured using the keyboard
#	configuration tool which is invoked through 
#
#		startmol --keyconfig
#
#	It is possible to configure "extra" keys manually. The syntax is
#
#	   remap_key:   <keycode>   <adbcode>    (fullscreen)
#	   remap_xkey:  <xkeycode>  <adbcode>    (X11 window)
#
#	Warning: Manual tweaking might interfere with the keyboard
#	configuration tool.
#
#	To find out the correct adbcode, consult the image 
#	/usr/share/doc/mol-0.9.XX/adbcodes.gif.
#
#	To determine the keycode, add
#
#	   show_key_trans:   yes
#
#	Unless the following line is uncommented, MOL will try to 
#	auto-configure the keyboard (in X-mode). For U.S. keyboards (and 
#	in particular for remote-X connections), this give a good result. 
#	If a non-US keyboard layout is used, it is sometimes better to 
#	disable this feature.
#
#	   disable_xkey_remap:	yes
#
