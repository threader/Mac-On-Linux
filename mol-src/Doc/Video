There is a full-screen video configuration tool available
(molvconfig).

This tool looks for video mode definitions in the
directory /usr/lib/mol/vmodes and in the file
/etc/fb.modes. The format is fbset compatible.

After running molvconfig, make sure the line

	enable_console_video:	yes

is present in the /etc/molrc file.
