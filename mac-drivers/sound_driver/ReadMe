Too many files?
===============

sdev project
	Generates the file 'SoundComponent.rsrc' file, the sound component.

sdev.rsrc
	Resources that should go be merged into the SoundComponent.rsrc target. Note
	that this file is _not_ in the CVS and must be obtained from a .sit.

Loader project
	Builds the 'MOLAudio (thng)' and 'MOLAudio' targets (from SoundComponent.rsrc).
	Currently, the thng target is not used (it doesn't load on older MacOS versions).

DevLoader project
	Builds 'DevLoader' which loads the sound component in the 'SoundComponent.rsrc' file
	(only used for testing).

MOLAudio: 
	The extension to be placed in the system folder. This is really an 'appe'
	background application which loads the sound component it contains (and then 
	quits immediately). 

MOLAudioComponent:
	This is the sound component (with file type 'thng'). It can be placed in the system
	folder instead of 'MOLAudio', but it will be partially loaded by non-MOL MacOS
	(it will show up Sound dialog). The problem is the 'wantsRegister' mechanism which
	doesn't seem to work at all (???) for PPC-native components. The 'appe' solution
	above is a workaround.
