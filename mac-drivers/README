================================================================
This directory contains the Mac side drivers used by MOL.
Since these drivers are bundled with the MOL source code as
binaries, there is no reason to build them unless you are a 
developer.
================================================================


Compiling with Code Warrior:
============================

All projects are stored in xml format. To reconstruct
a CodeWarrior project, do the following:

  1. Change the creator of the xml file to CodeWarrior
  2. Choose "Import..."
  3. Save the project using the filename obtained by stripping
     the xml suffix (if a different name is used, the proj_name.exp
     file won't be used).

Note: You should probably change the type/creator of all
text files. Code Warrior might refuse to compile certain files
otherwise.


Compiling with MPW:
===================

There are some Makefiles. However, they might not be up to date.


Built drivers:
==============

The build products are stored in the OF directory. NewWorld drivers
(e.g. 'osi_blk.nw') are ready for use. OldWorld drivers (e.g. 'osi_blk.pcirom') 
must be encoded further. Refer to the documentation in the OF directory.
