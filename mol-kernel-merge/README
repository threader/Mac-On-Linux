Currently, this isn't useful for anyone, unless you want to help to move the
MOL kernel module into the kernel.

It mostly does build now, patch Kconfig, put the MOL files in platforms/mol.  
Don't expect it to work yet though, the ASM still doesn't build.

Done:
 * Remove old kernel version code
 * Remove Darwin code
 * Removed some header files
 * Ran lindent on .c files
 * Removed some dead code
 * Fixed Makefile and made it build
 * Imported some more MOL files

In Progress:
 * Tighten up code by removing functions that aren't needed
 * Inline code that was previously a function due to multiple OS support
 * Integrate MOL configuration into the kernel (need to add all MOL opts?)
 * Rewrite ASM to remove m4 processor stuff

TODO:
 * Review and remove unneded code (dead code, etc.)
 * Remove code that's duplicated in the kernel
 * Document and ensure that comments make sense
 * Review for kernel inclusion (checkpatch, etc.)
 * Probably lots more
